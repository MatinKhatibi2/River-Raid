# River Ride (Terminal Game)

A terminal-based action game inspired by the classic *River Raid*. Navigate your ship through a narrowing river, avoid enemies and shoot them, collect fuel in your way. All inside your terminal window using Python and `curses`!

- Use **W A S D** to move:
  - `W` â€“ move up
  - `S` â€“ move down
  - `A` â€“ move left
  - `D` â€“ move right
- Press `SPACE` to shoot bullets upward
- Press `Q` to quit the game

Avoid crashing into the riverbanks (green blocks) or enemies (`E`). Collect fuel (`$`) to stay alive. Your fuel gradually decreases over time. Shoot enemies to gain score!
